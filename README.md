## Installation

Healthcare requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd healthcare-client
npm i
npm run start
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
npm run build:prod
cd dist/healthcare-client
http-server
```

## Continious Deployment
Our product uses Firebase as a place where we put our client code in.
Using github workflow, we can easily trigger a push event so that, we can deploy everytime the code is merged into master

```
# This file was auto-generated by the Firebase CLI
# https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools

name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on merge
'on':
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: npm install --force && npm run build

      - uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          repoToken: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
          firebaseServiceAccount: '${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_HEALTHCARE_B8858 }}'
          channelId: live
          projectId: healthcare-b8858

```
